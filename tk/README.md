# Ruby Tk

This is the easiest to use and most mature graphical interface available for
Ruby. Shoes is said to be the future but it is a rather immature work in
progress yet. (See my complaints [there](../shoes/README.md).)

There are lots of usable tutorials and they are easy to find. However, a
good reference is much harder to get by, so recording the best so far:

* http://www.rubydoc.info/stdlib/tk

## Tutorials tried so far:

* http://rubylearning.com/satishtalim/ruby_tk_tutorial.html (poor, with errors)
* https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_tk_guide.htm has a simple intro then goes on to widgets
* http://www.tkdocs.com/tutorial/ (syntax sometimes seems unrubbyish)

## Other Resources:

Sites that turned out to be useful:
